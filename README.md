# pk-rfc
Public Key SASL Mechanism RFC Draft

## About

This project is a point of collaboration around the definition of a SASL mechanism that allows SSH-style keypairs to be used for credential verification.  Anyone can contribute, either as an officially listed author (by adding author information to the XML document) or not.

## Issues and Pull Requests

Contributions should be in the form of issues and pull requests on the [GitHub project](https://github.com/dmlloyd/pk-rfc).  Pull requests should modify the source XML and example implementation only.  I will update the text rendering periodically.
