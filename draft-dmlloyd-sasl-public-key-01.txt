                  SASL Public Key Authentication (PK)
                    draft-dmlloyd-sasl-public-key-01

Abstract

   Thanks to the success of the Secure Shell (SSH; <rfc4251>), the usage
   of public key authentication as a more secure alternative to
   password-based authentication is widespread on the Internet today.
   Unfortunately, to date there is no standard way to reuse these
   existing types of credentials in most other protocols.

   This specification describes a family of Simple Authentication and
   Security Layer (SASL; <rfc4422>) authentication mechanisms which uses
   public/private key pairs to authenticate a user, including those
   currently in use for the purposes of SSH authentication.

1.  Introduction

   This specification describes a family of authentication mechanisms
   for performing public key authentication which provides a simple
   alternative to password-based authentication strategies.

   This family of mechanisms does not include negotiation of a security
   layer.  It is intended for use with an external security layer
   (optionally using channel binding [see RFC 5056]).

3.  PK Algorithm Overview

   The PK client is in possession of a user name and a private key.  The
   user name is sent to the server with a public key, along with a
   client-generated nonce.  The server retrieves the user information
   and compares the public key to the server's stored key.

   The server then sends a challenge to the client including a server
   nonce and the server's public key.  The client compares the server
   public key to a locally stored key for that host.

   The client then sends a message to the server consisting of a
   cryptographic signature produced by the user's private key over the
   channel binding data (if any) and the first client and server
   messages.

   The server replies with a cryptographic signature produced by the
   host's private key over the same data plus the client's signature
   message.
